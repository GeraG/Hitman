The main problem with this project was the lack of intro to the useful terminal commands in the case of the first question and it would have helped to give us a brief tutorial on how to use the tools needed. There was also some uncertainty in the spec, such as what the 5 second timeout means; does it refer to total time or does it refer to the default timeout to listen for packets. In addition, the spec does not go into detail about the expected responses that we should be seeing for traceroute and evasion so it was difficult to judge completion of those parts.
